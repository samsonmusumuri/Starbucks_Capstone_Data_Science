## Introduction 
This project is part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in conjunction with Starbucks.

This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one, get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

## Motivation 
Exploring the factors that drive customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app offers an exciting chance to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction through personalized and enticing offers. By creating a machine learning model for classification, we can predict how a customer will respond to a specific offer, leading to more effective and efficient marketing campaigns. Although understanding complex human behaviors influenced by numerous factors is challenging, this task provides an intriguing opportunity to apply  machine learning techniques. It's worth noting that the successful implementation of such a model could have broader implications beyond Starbucks, serving as a blueprint for other retail companies and showcasing the potential of data-driven decision-making to boost revenue and customer engagement. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this project could greatly contribute to the larger domain of customer behavior analysis. This is because it will facilitate a deeper comprehension of human behavioral patterns and help identify factors that truly engage us.
